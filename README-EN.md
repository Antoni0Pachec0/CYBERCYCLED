## Who are we?
We are a collective of idealists and passionate individuals in the fashion realm, where we believe that enjoying the identity provided by choosing authentic garments should not result in total ecocide but rather be a way to connect with our individuality and sustainability. We connect the community of eco-enthusiasts who want to dress fashionably with the most cutting-edge exhibitors of modified clothing in Latin America through blockchain technology and a tokenized marketplace.

## How do we do it?
We redefine the value within the fashion industry by tokenizing vintage, second-hand, and modified garments. With our valuation algorithm for each piece, we issue a token that provides traceability, economic value, and history. You can check out all these unique pieces of clothing on our marketplace and acquire them to look amazing while contributing to a better planet.

## Why do we do it?
The visibility of the upcycled garment designer community is crucial to us, where a garment becomes a piece of art instead of ending up in a landfill. We aim to contribute to reducing the climate catastrophe caused by the textile industry through what truly matters: durable and storied clothing has much more value than fast fashion.
